Spatial Audio Studio, 15 Westminster St., Mezzanine floor, room M11</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <em>Sponsored by the Computation, Technology, and Culture concentration and the Digital+Media Department</em></p>\n<p>Yasunao Tone (born 1935) is a Japanese-American artist, writer, theorist, and composer. According to critic Alan Cummings, he is “part of a whole generation of post-war iconoclasts who followed in the wake of John Cage's discovery of indeterminacy, determined to shake music and art out of their enslavement to the high art, romanticist ideals of the 19th century.” He co-founded Group Ongaku (Music group) in the early 1960s, has been active in the Fluxus movement since 1962, and has also been an organizer and participant in many important music and performance scenes including New York’s Downtown improvisors, and the European electronica experimentalists. An outstanding experimentalist, Yasunao coined the term \"paramedia art\" to describe his work, and his artistic inventions include prepared CD, interventions with an MP3 system and AI programm. Primarily a composer, Tone has worked in many media, creating pieces for electronics, computer systems, film, radio and television, as well as environmental art. His work is distinguished by conversion of text into music via images with analog and digital means, and with critique of medium in use (Music for 2CD Players, Solo for Wounded CD). Tone has presented concerts at the Kitchen, MoMA, the Guggenheim, Museum of Contemporary Art Barcelona, the Ars Electronica Festival, Centre George Pompidou, Sonic Lights in Amsterdam, ATP festivals and Lovebytes festivals, among many others. Select exhibitions include the Venice Biennale, numerous FLUXUS shows, \"The Japanese Avant-garde since 1945\" at the Guggenheim Museum, \"Bitstreams\" at the Whitney Museum, the Yokohama Triennale. Honors include the Ars Electronica Golden Nica award and the Foundation for Contemporary Arts award in music.</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1d5qfl6720\" class=\"taFHO sc-jqCOkK jbhBLB\">Video: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/175305422\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yasunao Tone: AI Deviation at ISSUE Project Room June 9th, 2016</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

He has performed live, taught workshops and created scores of unique instruments and installations since 2002 across Europe, North and South America, and New Zealand. <br><br><a href=\"http://macumbista.net/\">http://macumbista.net/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/macumbista/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.instagram.com/macumbista/</a><br><br><br>-----<br><br>On <strong>Tuesday March 19</strong>, the workshop will start at 7pm and feature a lecture: A Media Archaeology of Vector Graphics. The development of any kind of media technology combines utopian and dystopian tendencies, and nowhere is that more true than in the development of computer vector graphics. Taking the activation of the AN/FSQ-7 computers at the heart of the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) defense stations in the United States in 1958 as its starting point, this talk explores the military/scientific legacy at the heart of modern computing and attempts by artists of the 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s to decouple these tools from their destructive origins.<br><br>-----<br><br>On <strong>Wednesday March 20</strong>, the workshop will start at 6:30pm.  The focus will be on Holzer's Vector Synthesis library, which uses the Pure Data programming environment to investigate the direct relationship between sound+image. With it, you can draw Lissajous figures, render simple two- and three-dimensional shapes, and process photographs and video into vector artwork which can be displayed on oscilloscopes using audio signals. These shapes can also be further modified in real time using external audio sources such as voice, amplified instruments, or electronic synthesizers. This talk will introduce the basic concepts and capabilities of this publicly-available, free and open source audio+visual library. <a href=\"https://github.com/macumbista/vectorsynthesis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/macumbista/vectorsynthesis</a><br><br>-----<br><br>On <strong>Thursday night March 21</strong>, Derek Holzer will perform at <a href=\"http://www.machineswithmagnets.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Machines with Magnets</a> in Pawtucket, RI.  Further details can be found at the FB event page here: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/254381318802981/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.facebook.com/events/254381318802981/</a><br><br><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://sound.risd.edu/media/posts/14/03_19_poster-web-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1100\" height=\"1500\"></p>",
