                <li><b>Sonic Practices</b><br> DM-3104: Fall 2018 / Spring 2019<br> <em>Mark Cetilia, Andrea Pensado</em><br> Sonic Practices is a graduate-level research group focused on acoustic, electronic, and/or computer-based means of sound production
                  and reception. Participants explore audio culture and technology while developing experimental approaches to composition, performance, recording, and/or listening. Areas of investigation include, but are not limited to: audio programming
                  languages, embedded/mobile computing for sound and music, spatial audio, sound synthesis, audio electronics, sonification and auditory display, electroacoustic music composition and improvisation, field recording and soundscape studies,
                  sound installation and performance, and sonic interaction design. Each semester, course content changes in response to a new unifying theme upon which students base individual and team-based research projects. Meetings consist of discussions,
                  workshops, critiques, and collaborations that support students' individual inquiries, the exchange of ideas, and the exploration of research methodologies. <br> <br> </li>

                <li><b>Of Sound and Vision</b><br> CTC 2007: Wintersession 2019<br> <em>Mark Cetilia</em><br> This intensive studio course investigates computational approaches to generating sound and image in real time. Precedents from experimental film
                  and video, as well as sound, installation, and performance art will be examined in relationship both to human perception and the students' artistic practice. The course will include discussion of key historical works and texts, hands-on
                  demonstrations and in-class projects, as well as critical engagement with new works by class members. Students will use programming environments such as Max and its object libraries for sound and video, MSP and Jitter, to explore the
                  creative and expressive potentials of an intermedia production practice, culminating in the development of a larger work that incorporates knowledge gained throughout the course. <br> <br> </li>

                <li><b>Spatial Audio</b><br> CTC-2006: Spring 2019<br> <em>Shawn Greenlee</em><br> Spatial Audio focuses on the creation of immersive 3D sound experiences. In this course, students analyze and explore how the sensation of space is activated
                  in the listener by making works using spatial audio techniques. These methods include high-order ambisonics, vector-based amplitude panning, multichannel surround, and binaural audio, among others. Throughout the semester, a series of
                  exercises addressing technical and theoretical issues provide students with the necessary experience to produce midterm and final projects. Coursework involves computational approaches to sound design and composition, with instruction
                  in the audio programming language Max and digital audio workstations, i.e. Ableton Live and Reaper. Students have recurring access to a 25-channel loudspeaker array for the development of works. Readings from psychology, philosophy,
                  the arts, and sound studies support class discussions and critiques. Students will need a laptop computer (Mac or Windows) and a Max software license (educational pricing available from cycling74.com). Previous experience with digital
                  audio software recommended.
                  <br> <br> </li>

                <li><b>Digital + Media Studio/Seminar and Thesis Project courses</b><br> Fall 2018 / Spring 2019<br> Graduate-level core studio coursework for the D+M MFA program. D+M students can receive training and gain access to the sound lab at 15 Westminster
                  for relevant projects.
                  <br> <br> </li>

                <li><b>Programming Sound: Performance Systems</b><br>Returning in Fall 2019<br><em>Instructor TBA</em><br>Programming Sound: Performance Systems focuses on programming and designing computer-based systems for sound art and music performance. Centered on the dataflow programming
                  language, Pure Data (Pd), the course will be of substantial benefit to students who desire a rigorous and fast-moving foundation in algorithmic approaches to sound design. The course simultaneously facilitates explorations in sound synthesis,
                  audio signal processing, electronics, mobile platforms, gesture-based human computer interaction, and instrument building with microcontrollers and sensors. Coursework involves weekly homework in the form of online lectures and exercises
                  with class sessions reserved for demonstrations, workshops, and project assistance. The course emphasizes modularity and reuse of code. Students will present their work in a public concert during the last week of the semester. Additional
                  notes: In order to conduct work in this course, students will need a laptop computer running a recent OS: Mac, Windows, or Linux. Previous programming experience is recommended, but not required.
