            <li><b>Introduction to Computation</b><br>
            IDISC-1571: Fall 2016, Wintersession 2017, Spring 2017<br>
            <em>Carl Lostritto, Mark Cetilia, Chris Novello</em><br>
            Introduction to Computation focuses on computational techniques, methods, and ideas in the context of art and design.
            Studio projects first center on the design of algorithms then shift to involve computer programming and scripting.
            Critical attention is given to code as a body of crafted text with significant aesthetic, philosophical, and social dimensions,
            as well as the tension, conflict, and potential possible when computation generates, informs, or interacts with drawings, materials,
            forms, and spaces. Historical and contemporary works of computational art and design will be presented and assigned for analysis.
            This course is open to students of all majors and is designed for those with little or no experience in programming.
            In order to conduct work in this course, students will need a laptop computer. This course fulfills one of two core studio requirements for CTC Concentration.

            <li><b>Ambient Interfaces: Activated Objects</b>
            <br>IDISC-1535: Spring 2017<br>
            <em>Alejandro Borsani</em><br>
            This course is a practical and conceptual exploration into electronics sensors, processors and actuators in the context of interactive art and design.
            Students will turn everyday objects into "ambient interfaces" or "responsive systems" that respond to the conditions of the human body, data networks,
            and the environment. Contemporary works of art and design - from kinetic sculpture and sound art to installation, architecture and product design -
            will be examined through readings and presentations. Open source hardware (Arduino) and software (Processing) will be taught along with the fundamentals of
            electronic circuitry. Emphasis is given to the development of creative projects (individual or collaborative), followed by an iterative implementation process
            (planning, prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining). The course is structured around a series of tutorials and exercises, culminating in a final project.
            Students also present work-in-progress and prototypes during class reviews to receive qualitative feedback from the class and the instructor.
            Participants will engage with physical computing conceptually and technically in their studio work and are encouraged to leverage their individual backgrounds
            to excel in the respective context. Prior experience with electronics and programming is recommended but not required.

            <li><b>Art, Life, and the Internet. Or did we miss anything?</b>
            <br>IDISC-1541: Spring 2017<br>
            <em>Kai Franz, Asli Serbest</em><br>
            Following his claim that “everyone is an artist,” Joseph Beuys introduced the idea of a “social sculpture” to imagine a broader definition of art and creativity;
            a definition whose neo-avant-gardist objective was to reunite art and life. The “social sculpture,” a social organism characterized by openness, spirituality,
            and fantasy, was aimed at shaping the entire society and was meant to be accomplished cooperatively, spontaneously, and with the help of various disciplines.
            Today, the question might be: how can we help to turn the Internet into a “social sculpture?”
            Operating on the assumption that everyday life and the Internet have become indissociable, this studio course investigates the transformative impact of the
            Internet on art and life. The course will trace a lineage from the rise of NetArt to contemporary movements such as New Aesthetic and Post-Internet Art, and
            explore how the roots of these movements relate to Dada, Fluxus, and Internet culture in general. Simultaneously, we will revisit art historical discourses on
            the relationship of art and life to gain critical understanding of how artists have engaged the blurring of art/life, and more generally to examine the role of
            the Internet in everyday life and our society.
            This studio aims to overcome preconceived notions of a separation of theory and practice. Readings and discussions will help to form a body of research that
            will in turn shape the creative student work. At the end of the term, both come together in an exhibition that unites this research and the individual work.

            <li><b>Argentina: Hi/Low Tech</b>
            <br>IDISC-1513: Wintersession 2017<br>
            <em>Paula Gaetano-Adi, Alejandro Borsani</em><br>
            Argentina: Hi/Low Tech is a travel course designed as an immersive experience into material culture through making with electronics and physical computing.
            Latin America has a long-standing and unrivaled history of hybridity that began over 500 years ago and persists until today. Contemporary Argentina is not an exception,
            and exists within globalizing processes of cross-cultural contacts that create world markets for money and material goods, migrants, and information.
            This course will provide comprehensive exposure for recognizing the nature and value of "a world of sciences and arts" multiple scientific, technological, and artistic
            traditions adapted to local materials, regional needs, resources, and interests. Centralized in Buenos Aires, with our headquarter studio at the local makerspace,
            Espacio Nixso, this course is a hands-on workshop which will introduce the fundamentals of DIY electronic circuits, embedded programming, sensor signal processing,
            simple mechanisms, and time-based behavior; along with an in-depth investigation into the forms uses, interpretations, and meanings of objects, products, images, and
            environments in everyday Argentina. Besides our partnership with the local community at Espacio Nixso, during this course we will be working closely with two very
            different material libraries. The first one dedicated to the collection of industrial solid wastes located in Avellaneda, one of the foremost wholesale and industrial
            centers of Argentina, situated within the greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The other material library is located in Oberá, Province of Misiones, in the
            northeastern corner of the country, about 700 miles from Buenos Aires. This library collects regional materials, (organic and locally manufactured) such as wood,
            minerals, metals, textiles, and clay. Students will attend field trips to museums, local informal markets, milongas, popular and folklore music shows, visits to
            different worker cooperatives, among other daily field trips. The studio will also have a strong component into reading discussions and lectures, as well as weekly
            studio visits and talks from renowned local artists, designer, and scholars. Students will keep an active travel journal and sketchbook in response to site visits,
            assigned readings, and short assignments. These materials combined with an immersion in the Argentinian lifestyle will inform the final project - an interactive object
            examining the relationship between hi and low technologies, knowledges, and materials. The final projects will be exhibited at final review with guest critics and
            open to the general public.

            <li><b>Programming Sound: Performance Systems</b>
            <br>IDISC-1528: Fall 2016<br>
            <em>Shawn Greenlee</em><br>
            Programming Sound: Performance Systems focuses on programming and designing computer-based systems for sound art and music performance.
            Centered on the dataflow programming language, Pure Data (Pd), the course will be of substantial benefit to students who desire a rigorous and
            fast-moving foundation in algorithmic approaches to sound design. The course simultaneously facilitates explorations in sound synthesis, audio
            signal processing, electronics, mobile platforms, gesture-based human computer interaction, and instrument building with microcontrollers and sensors.
            Coursework involves weekly homework in the form of online lectures and exercises with class sessions reserved for demonstrations, workshops, and
            project assistance. The course emphasizes modularity and reuse of code. Students will present their work in a public concert during the last week of
            the semester. Additional notes: In order to conduct work in this course, students will need a laptop computer running a recent OS: Mac, Windows, or Linux.
            Previous programming experience is recommended, but not required.
