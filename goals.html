            <h5>Learning goals</h5>
            <p>The program seeks to advance students’:
<ul>
<li>Understanding of the fundamental ideas and techniques of writing in computer programming languages toward their utilization
   in a range of art and design fields. Here, algorithmic thinking and procedural literacy is emphasized, with a noted,
   overall gain being improved fluency with computational media. This includes developing a readiness and agility for
   the extemporization and composition of systems and processes through writing source code.</li>
<ul><li>Procedural literacy. The ability to read and write processes, with an understanding of the interplay between cultural practices and technological-meditation.</li></li>
<li>Algorithmic thinking. The ability to abstractly construct and understand algorithms independent from use within a programming language.</li>
</ul>
<li>Preparedness for industries and practices where computer language competence is an increasingly important factor,
  for instance where creative individuals are needed to bridge between art, design, and engineering areas. Value: the ability to move between various forms and divisions of labor.</li>
<li>Capacity for meaningful collaborations and communication in technology-oriented work that spans disciplines, including numerous research contexts.
  Value: aptitude for team-oriented work, uniting and translating for specialists.</li>
<li>Analytical skills in the survey of historical and contemporary works, artifacts, and schools of thought,
  including the ability to intelligently engage in the critical discourse of computational media, technology studies, and software studies.
  Value: gaining an informed perspective on contemporary and future culture, and digital mediation with an awareness of the benefits and detriments.</li>
</ul>
In completing the CTC concentration, students will be able to:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Write source code, author software, and program hardware for making their own works of art and design</li>
<li>Discuss significant historical developments in computational technology including the work of key engineers, scientists, programmers, designers and artists</li>
<li>Compare and contrast theories surrounding the cultural reception and production of new and emerging media technologies</li>
<li>Demonstrate ability in critical discourse surrounding computation, technology, and culture through speaking, dialogue, writing, and artistic production</li>
</ul>
